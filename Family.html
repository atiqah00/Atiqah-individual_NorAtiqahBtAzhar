      <p>My family is made up of 7 people and 5 of of them are my siblings. 
        My father, Azhar bin Abdul Rahim, is 55 years old. My father worked as a Lecturer at the Industrial Training Institute in Jelapang, Perak. 
        While my mother was named Rohana Bt Ramli who was 50 years old. My mother was just a housewife and a very loving mother. 
        Next, my eldest sister named Nur Izzati Bt Azhar. Now she is 27 years old and still not married. My sister works as an instructor at Brainy Bunch Bangi Branch. 
        The second child is my brother, Mohammad Faiz Bin Azhar, who is pursuing his studies at the UiTM Puncak Perdana. Before forgetting he was 24 years old. 
        The third is myself Nor Atiqah Bt Azhar, aged 20 and currently undergoing a diploma at UiTM Merbok. 
        Then the fourth child was my sister, Nor Hazirah Bt Azhar, who was 17 years old. 
        Lastly, my youngest brother, 14-year-old which is his name is Muhammad Haziq Bin Azhar. They both studied at the same school, SMK Bandar Baru Putera.
